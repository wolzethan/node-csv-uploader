Use csvtojson to get the file into a workable format.
You need to make a decision tree based on if it's old or new...
This can be handle via front end.

If it's new you just create a new table with the new headers....

if it's an existing table you are creating you first validate headers...

if headers match the existing example then great.  Import it.

If not you need to send back with the problem headers and a list so that
the user can match them back up

after they'll send back an object that looks like this {'old' : 'new'}
this will replace the new with the old and the system can continue to parse.
